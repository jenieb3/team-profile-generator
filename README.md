  ## Description

  This project uses npm inquirer package to dynamically generate a team profile. I found this project similar to the readme.md generator as users are propmted to input the required information for the different roles in the team. An HTML file is generated which can then be styled using CSS.

  ## Installation

  First node.js needs to be installed. Next run the npm command line npm init before coding. 

  ## Usage

  This Professional Team is great to display your organisation structure and makes the team more accessible. When the email address is clicked the user is presented with options to correspond with the default email address of the user. Similarily, when the github user name is clicked the user is taken to the GitHub page is displayed.
